# pyspark-template

This is a pyspark project template


## Describe here your project


For Task 1

I have used the dataframe

For Task 2

I have used dataframe as well

For Task 3

I have given both implementation of RDD and dataframe

Please note 

I ran many many interation of task 3 with different learning rate.

THe plot of task 2 is much smoother as the the cost drops as expected 

while for task 3 the cost does not drop as fast as expected

I have given two plots with different learning rates

Also I have seen that with the same code base on small dataset the cost drops while on the large dataset if we try out different learning rate the cost increase
I see no explanation why this could happen but I have attahed the output as well to show it as a seperate file
THe plot where taken using matplotlib  , the code is not given as it was not asked 



# Submit your python scripts .py 

If your assignment has 3 tasks you need to commit the 3 scripts only and overwrite them. You can then delete the script number 4 ( main_task4.py 
)

If your assignment has 4 tasks then you can use all of them. 

# Other Documents. 

You can write your task description in this Markdown file or You can generate PDF file and added to the doc/ folder of your repository. 

Please note in your README.md file where your task description file is.  


# How to run  

Run the task 1 by submitting the task to spark-submit.

spark-submit main_task1.py 

```



```python

spark-submit main_task2.py 

```
